git init is used to initalize the project

git restore is used to make staged files to unstaged and for discard also;

to link the github and git we have two ways one is git clone and another is git remote this is the both methods we can link the git and github

if we are pushing the code for the first time then u have to give git push -u origin main

if we have assingend one task we are working on it and if we want to stop that work and have to complete the another work then we have to use the stash command. 

how can we work is 


git stash--it will go to the parking lot

git stash apply--it will take the code from the parking lot and keep

we can do multiple stash but we have to mention the index --(imp)

git stash list will give the list of files with index

git stash apply <index-number>



if we have the multiple branch in the git hub if we are cloneing then it will give main branch only if we want another branch means we have to mention that like git clone -b <branch-name> url

if we want to switch the branch then we have to use "checkout"
git checkout <branch-name>


.gitignore -for suppose we have to ignore some files then we will use this to avoid the files to commit ex.target file in maven
